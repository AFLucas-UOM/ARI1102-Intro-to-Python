    "We will be creating an object representing a deck of cards - with each card being an object itself. You have the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Card` class should have a suit (**H**earts, **D**iamonds, **C**lubs, **S**pades) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K).\n",
    "- The `Deck` class will start off with a list of all 52 cards.\n",
    "- The `Deck` class will have a method to `shuffle` the cards and rearrange them in random order.\n",
    "- The `Deck` class will have a `deal` method to draw a single card from the deck. Once the card is drawn, it is discarded."
