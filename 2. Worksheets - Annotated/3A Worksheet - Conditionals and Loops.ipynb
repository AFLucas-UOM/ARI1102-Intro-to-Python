    "\n",
    "**Other Languages**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (x) {\n",
    "    if (y) {\n",
    "        <code-statement>;\n",
    "    }\n",

    "\n",
    "Python gets rid of `(` `)` and `{` `}` by incorporating two main factors: a `:` and *whitespace*. The if statement is ended with a colon, and whitespace is used (indentation) to describe what takes place in case of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major difference is the lack of semicolons in Python. Semicolons are used to denote statement endings in many other languages, but in Python, the end of a line is the same as the end of a statement.\n",

    "Note how Python is so heavily driven by code indentation and whitespace. This means that code readability is a core part of the design of the Python language.\n",

    "## Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. Conditional statements give us this ability. The simplest form is the <code>if</code> statement:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean expression after `if` is called the **condition**. If it is true, the indented statement runs. If not, the indented statement is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "`if` statements have the same structure as function definitions: a header followed by an indented body. Statements like this are called compound statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there has to be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a placeholder for code you havenâ€™t written yet). In that case, you can use the `pass` statement, which does nothing.\n",
    "```python \n",
    "if x < 0:\n",
    "    pass # TODO: need to handle negative values!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### if, elif, else Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "`if` Statements in Python allows us to tell the program to perform alternative actions based on a certain set of conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verbally, we can imagine we are telling the computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"If this case happens, perform some action.\"\n",

    "We can then expand the idea further with `elif` and `else` statements, which allow us to tell the computer:\n",
